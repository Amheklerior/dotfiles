# dotfiles repo

This is my personal dotfiles repo. Feel free to explore it, copy bits and pieces for your own dotfiles, or fork the whole repo.

> **! NOTE**\
> These dotfiles are tailored to my liking. If you want to use them, fork the repo, review the code, remove anything you don't want or need, and enjoy.

## Platform Compatibility ⚠

The dotfiles and setup automation scripts in this repository are designed with macOS systems in mind.

## Installation process

The installation process is largely automated, with only a few manual steps involved.

In a nutshell, to install the dotfiles on a brand new system, simply run the following shell commands:

```sh
# install the command line dev tools
xcode-select --install 

# clone this dotfile repository
git clone https://github.com/Amheklerior/dotfiles-repo $HOME/.dotfiles-repo

# move into the .dotfiles directory
cd $HOME/.dotfiles-repo

# run the install script and follow the instructions...
./bootstrap.sh

```

## Repository Overview

Here's an high level overview of the repository structure

```sh
dotfiles-repo/
⋮
├── dotfiles/
│   └── # home of the actual dotfiles 
├── prefs/
│   └── # where all system and apps preferences are stored
├── scripts/
│   └── # scripts used by the automated setup process
⋮
├── bootstrap.sh # the automated setup entry-point script
├── Brewfile # the bundle of all system packages, apps, and vscode extensions to be installed
└── README.md # this readme file
```

The [`bootstrap.sh`](./bootstrap.sh) script is the entry point that will kick off the automated setup process for a new machine. It is designed to be [**idempotent**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence), which means you can safely run it multiple times and expect operations to be done only once.

It runs the setup scripts in the [`scripts/`](./scripts/) directory.

The system package manager it uses is [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh), which gets first installed and then used to install all system packages, apps, fonts, and vscode extensions defined in the [`Brewfile`](./Brewfile).

The actual dotfiles are located in the [`dotfiles/`](./dotfiles/) directory. They are symlinked into the user's `$HOME` dir using [`GNU stow`](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). This makes it easy to update them without having to manually synk them between the system and the repo.

The process will also load all settings and preferences for the MacOS system and the installed apps. You can find the  [`prefs/macos/defaults.sh`](./prefs/macos/defaults.sh) is the script that sets all system preferences, the apps prefs occupy the rest of the [`prefs/`](./prefs/) direcotry.
