# TODOs

- [ ] Integrate `neovim` configs
- [ ] Integrate [`tmux`](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) (or [`zellij`](https://zellij.dev/)) configs
- [ ] Integrate [`yabai`](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) configs
- [ ] Consider a plugin manager for zsh, like:
  - [`zap`](https://github.com/zap-zsh/zap) or [znap](https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-snap) - minimal and super-fast, with static or inline config (active repo)
  - [`antidote`](https://antidote.sh) - minimal, blazingly fast, with static config (moderate repo activity)
  - [`sheldon`](https://github.com/rossmacarthur/sheldon) - lightweight, medium complexity, static config via a TOML file (active repo)
  - [`zi`](https://github.com/z-shell/zi) - successor of [`zinit`](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit), feature-rich, modular, kinda complex, inline config, fast (active repo)
- [ ] Consider splitting the repo into different ones (codes, wallpapers, nvim, dotfiles, dev-env, etc.)
- [ ] Add a prompt to avoid touch-id setup for sudo access (not all devices has touch-id)
- [ ] Rethink repos management, folder structure and workflow (cli for bulk ops, optimize git worktree workflow, etc.)
- [ ] Add `Linux` system support?!
