# TODOs

- [ ] Improve DX (better logging, prompts to skip parts of the process, etc.)
- [ ] Automate `macosx prefs` setup
- [ ] Automate `app prefs` setup (via plain `defaults` script or using [`mackup`](https://github.com/lra/mackup))
- [ ] Integrate `neovim` configs
- [ ] Integrate [`tmux`](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) (or [`zellij`](https://zellij.dev/)) configs
- [ ] Integrate [`yabai`](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) configs
- [ ] Consider a plugin manager for zsh, like:
  - [`zinit`](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit) - power users, who wants finegrained control over zsh env
  - [`zplug`](https://github.com/zplug/zplug) - featurerich but lightweight, users who need advanced features and customization options
  - [`zap`](https://github.com/zap-zsh/zap) or [znap](https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-snap) - minimal and super fast manager, for users who prioritize perf and simplicity
  - [`sheldon`](https://github.com/rossmacarthur/sheldon) - lightweight and configurable via a TOML file
  - [`zi`](https://github.com/z-shell/zi) - a more lightweight version of zinit
- [ ] Add `Linux` system support
