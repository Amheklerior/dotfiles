## Complete the Apple's welcome journey

Follow the steps presented to you, making sure you skip migration assistant and do the following instead:

- set fav languages to: `en-US` and `it`
- set country to: `Italy`
- set keyboard input lang to: `en-US` and `it`
- connect apple account via the personal apple-id
- create a computer account: `Andrea Amato` (`amheklerior`)
- check the _allow my apple account to reset this password_ checkbox
- keep FileVault disabled (will be [enabled afterwards](./setup-guide.md#enable-filevault-disk-encryption))
- after completion, update the mac to the lates OS version available

_**NOTE**. Leave the rest as is (accessibility settings, services, payment cards, etc..)_

## Connect internet accounts

Go to `System Settings` > `Internet Accounts` and add the following accounts:

- my main personal google account for email and calendar
- my secondary yahoo account for emails only
- my work google account for calendar only

## Setup touch id

Go to `System Settings` > `Touch ID & Password`, and register 3 alternative fingerprints.

_**NOTE**. This is only relevant on laptop devices (i.e. it's not applicable to mac mini)_

## Setup Apple Wallet

Open the Apple Wallet app and register all payment cards, one by one.

Make sure to enable `hide-my-email` for payments via Apple Wallet.  

_**NOTE**. This is only relevant on laptop devices (it requires a magic keyboard to be setup on mac mini)_

## Install CLI dev tools

Open a new terminal window and run the following shell command:

```sh
xcode-select --install 
```

_**NOTE**. an installation window will popup. Follow the instructions._

## Install dotfiles

Open a new terminal window and run the following shell commands:

```sh
# clone this dotfile repository via https git protocol
git clone https://github.com/Amheklerior/dotfiles-repo $HOME/.dotfiles-repo

# move into the .dotfiles directory
cd $HOME/.dotfiles-repo

# run the install script and follow the instructions...
./bootstrap.sh
```

## Setup system preferences

You can do that as part of the [`bootstrap.sh`](../bootstrap.sh) installation script - the script will prompt if you want to proceed with setting up sys preferences.

Alternatively, open a new terminal window and run the following shell command:

```sh
source $HOME/.dotfiles-repo/scripts/load_sys_prefs.sh
```

Restart the system to make sure all new preferences get loaded.

## Enable FileVault disk encryption

Go to `System Settings` > `Privacy & Security` > `FileVault`, and turn it on.

Make sure to save the recovery-key on the [dotfiles repo's `/private` dir](../private/).

## Setup apps preferences

First, [disable System Integrity Protection (SIP)](./setup-guide.md#enablingdisabling-sip-system-integrity-protection-on-macos) (This is necessary to be able to setup Apple apps preferences via scripts).

Then, open a new terminal window and run the following shell commands:

```sh
source $HOME/.dotfiles-repo/scripts/load_app_prefs.sh
```

[Re-eneble the SIP](./setup-guide.md#enablingdisabling-sip-system-integrity-protection-on-macos) and restart.
